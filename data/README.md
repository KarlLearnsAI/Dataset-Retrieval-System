### How to get the data and weights?

The data and weights have been uploaded to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VxxqbEuf1JmInqJlgmqDwc0Py3uKkqnn?usp=sharing), since they are too large for Github. Simply download and unzip within this folder.

The following structure should be created:

information-retrieval/data/data/...
information-retrieval/weights/...
